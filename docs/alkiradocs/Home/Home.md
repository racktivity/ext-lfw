#Welcome to the Alkira Project

The Alkira Project is an effort to have a powerful and customizable documentation platform. The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use structured wiki as content management system.

##What is Alkira?
Alkira is a wiki documentation platform, developed by [Incubaid](http://www.incubaid.com). Alkira uses the [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which is a plain text format. 
The platform converts the wiki files into HTML, with the advantage that you can completely customize the look and feel of the HTML output.

Alkira is integrated in [PyLabs 5][pl], which gives you to possibility to modify or extend it to your own needs.

##Why Alkira?
Unlike most wikis, Alkira renders on the client side, not on the server side, which results in a higher performance due to a decreased server load. If Alkira lacks a functionality, you can easily add it yourself, thanks to the integration in PyLabs 5.

##Markdown
Alkira uses the Markdown syntax, check the [Markdown][md] page for more details. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

##Macros
On the Alkira platform, you can easily add [macros][] in your documentation. A macro gives you the possibility to add extra functionality on a page, for example add dynamic content such as graphics or database views.
Alkira has already a set of default macros, but of course nothing can stop you from creating your own macros. You can find the list of default Alkira macros **[here][macros]**.
