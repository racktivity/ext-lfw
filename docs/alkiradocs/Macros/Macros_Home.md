# Alkira Macros

As we have mentioned, Alkira is highly customizable; this is due to the fact that you can develop your own macros. These macros can have a wide range of usage, from highlighting code and showing a Google map, to adding a Wizard.

A [How to Create a Macro][] page has also been written to explain and ease the development of further macros.
