#Adding a Pagetree Column

When you want a pagetree column in your space, you have to create a file `pagetree.md`.
Whenever Alkira detects this file, it will automatically generate a column on the left side. In this file you can add any information that you want, but it is clear that it will be mainly used for filling it with a [pagetree][] of your documentation.
