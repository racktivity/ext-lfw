#Alkira Integrated Development Environment
When you install a PyLabs Application ([PyApp][]), a basic Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is provided in your application.
With this IDE you can not only create code for your application, but also update or correct existing code.

The provided IDE is not a fully fledged IDE, but it is a nice and easy feature which comes in handy when you urgently needs code updates and you don't have a IDE at hand.

Some of the IDE's features:
* code immediately available in PyApp

* code highlighting for Python
<br/>
<br/>
![CodeHighlight][imgCode]
<br/>
<br/>
* TAB-completion in the `q`-name space (CTRL-SPACE)
<br/>
<br/>
![TabCompletion][imgTabCompletion]


##Working with the IDE
Before you can run the Alkira IDE, you have to create at least one [project][]. Once you have a project, select the __IDE__ space.
In the left column, select the project on which you want to work.

In the tree of your project you can:
* create a new directory
* create a new file
* rename directories or files
* delete directories or files

These actions are all called by right-clicking on a directory or file name.


##File Management
To open a file, double-click the file in the directory tree. The file is opened in a tab in the workspace of the IDE.
To save a file in the IDE, click the icon next to the file name in the tab:
<br/>
<br/>
![SaveFile][imgSaveFile]
<br/>
<br/>
When you create a file, make sure that you add the `.py` extension to your file name.
