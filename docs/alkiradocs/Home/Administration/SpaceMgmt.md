#Alkira Space Management
A space in a PyLabs Application ([PyApp][]) is a unit to gather functionalities in a logical way. This way you can split you PyApp in different sections, each having their own specific function.
For example put all the application interface windows in one space and keep them shielded from the documentation space.

To manage the spaces in your PyApp, you must belong to the _Admins_ group or to a group that has space administration rights.

In this section you learn to:

* create new spaces
* rename a space
* delete a space

It is impossible to update or remove the default PyApps spaces 'IDE' and 'Admin'.


##Creating a Space
To create a new space:

1. Select the __Admin__ space of the PyApp.
2. Go to the __Spaces__ page. An overview of existing spaces appears.
3. Click __Create New Space__, a form appears to create a space.

<br/>
![CreateSpace][imgCreateSpace]
<br/>
<br/>
4. Provide a name for the space and click __Create Space__. 
The new space appears in the list of spaces.

**Important**

Do not use white spaces in the name of your space.
