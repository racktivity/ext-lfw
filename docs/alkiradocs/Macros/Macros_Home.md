#Alkira Macros
As we have mentioned, Alkira is highly customizable; this is due to the fact that you can develop your own macros, which are written in _JavaScript_.
These macros can have a wide range of usage, from highlighting code and showing a Google map, to adding a Wizard.

The macro files themselves (JavaScript files) are stored in `/opt/qbase5/www/lfw/js/macros` and must have unique names.

In this section you can find an overview of the available macros and how you can create [your own macro][howto].
