#Generic Macro
The `generic` macro which renders content based on the PyLabs tags defined in the body of the macro and the context of the page.

The content that this macro renders is a result of the execution of certain tasklets. These tasklets are available in:

    /opt/qbase5/pyapps/<yourapp>/impl/portal/pylabsmacro/<macroname>

Currently there are two test tasklets present in that directory:

* test1.py
* test2.py

When the Generic macro is called with 'debug' as one of the labels, `test1.py` is being executed. When the Generic macro is called with 'demo' as a label, `test2.py` is being executed.
See below for more details about the Generic Macro.


##Parameters

* The body of the macro should be a list of space separated tags and labes as defined by the Pylabs Tag format.


##Example 1
The tasklet `test1.py` lists all the tags and labels in a page. As we have mentioned in explaining how the search functions, all the pages are created with default tags that are:

* space:space\_name
* page:page\_name

Where `space_name` is the name of the space and `page_name` is the name of the page. Sample 1 is the result of calling the Generic macro with 'debug' as one of the labels; code is shown below:

    [[generic]]debug tagkey:tagvalue label sample[[/generic]]


###Sample 1

---
[[generic]]debug tagkey:tagvalue label[[/generic]]


##Example 2

The tasklet `test2.py` on the other hand, only prints out a default message. Sample 2 is the result of calling the Generic macro with 'demo' as a label; code is shown below:

    [[generic]]a:b demo[[/generic]]


###Sample 2

---
[[generic]]a:b demo[[/generic]]
