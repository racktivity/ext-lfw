#Alkira Project Management
Each PyApp has its own built-in [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)][ide]. The IDE allows you to develop and extend your PyApp, even from inside your application.
An Alkira project is then similar to an IDE project, a structural unit consisting of files and folders. 

In a project you define which directories must be included. The sub-directories and files are also automatically included in the project.

In this section you learn to:

* create a project
* delete a project


##Creating a Project
To create a new project:

1. Select the __Admin__ space of the PyApp.
2. Go to the __Projects__ page. An overview of existing projects appears.
3. In the tree structure, right-click on the directory where you want to create the project, and select __Create Project Here__. 
A form appears to create the space.
![NewProject][imgNewProject]
4. Provide a name for your project and click __Ok__.
The project appears in the list of _Available Projects_.

To access the project and start creating files, you have to go to the [IDE][] space.


##Deleting a Project
To delete a project:

1. Select the __Admin__ space of the PyApp.
2. Go to the __Projects__ page. An overview of existing projects appears.
3. In the list of _Available Projects_, click __delete__ next to the project that you want to delete. A confirmation window appears.
![DeleteProject][imgDeleteProject].
4. Click __Ok__ to delete the project. The project is deleted, but possible created files within the project remain.
